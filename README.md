Cluster Project
11.03 - Have found out that most of the translation need to be done in bundle.js - Dev and Fury together with Phoenix will work to get this done for beta testing.
11.03 - CDN (  cdncluster.eu ) is updated with the cdn files. Domain aint activated with cloudflare until all files are fixed this to handle the cache issue.
- Most of old cdn and domains from old owner should be removed. Phoenix have added gta5cluster.com to the projects domain list not activated to any host yet!
- suprp.eu is still used for beta for forum with more.
